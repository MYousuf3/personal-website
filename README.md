## About Me

I am a software engineer passionate about building scalable systems, machine learning applications, and developer-focused tools. With experience at companies like Meta, John Deere, and Johnson & Johnson, I have worked on projects spanning distributed systems, financial forecasting, and healthcare data engineering. Currently pursuing a BS/MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a perfect GPA, I strive to merge strong fundamentals with hands-on impact. Beyond work, I enjoy problem solving, HPC, and innovative side projects.
